# OpenPolis patrimoni scripts 

In this repository I'm collecting some useful scripts to gather and analyze data from [http://patrimoni.openpolis.it](http://patrimoni.openpolis.it) 


## Investments
The aim for [Investments script](src/investments.py) is to get all investments from italian politician in a csv file, so you can use excel or other too to visualize data, for example:

![a list of investments from italian politicians in 2014](investments2014.png)

In this example you can see that many politicians have investments in enel and eni

# Future works

I hope to have time explain this scripts and find new way to visualize data
